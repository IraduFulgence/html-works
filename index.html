CSS lets developers and designers define what a web page looks like and how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser. Every website that you visit (with some incredibly rare exceptions) uses CSS to make the user experience and interface look inviting, which means that learning the basics of CSS is an essential part of becoming a web developer or designer.</p>

This approach is a lot like trying to teach a foreign language by having students read the dictionary. </p>
